					<p align="justify">He himself starts flowering<br>
While watering the plants and bushes of other<br>
Patting the milch cows and buffaloes<br>
Praying for everyone&rsquo;s sons and cattle<br>
Putting his hand on the plough<br>
Prays for the well-being of all<br>
Becomes soil working with the soil<br>
<br>
He has brought with his own hands<br>
The green, the white and the blue revolution<br>
And still flows on his body<br>
A dry rivulet.<br>
<br>
His lean body burns in May and June<br>
And on the other side there are<br>
Shining and Silken bodies<br>
Searching for happiness in other bodies<br>
And his wounded by generations thoughts<br>
Repeatedly tells him<br>
All this is merely a game fate plays.<br>
<br>
Sometimes he ponders<br>
No matter there are crocodiles in the sea<br>
But fishes keep on swimming merrily<br>
Birds have the sky to fly<br>
And nests to live<br>
And what home I got ?<br>
A country with a culture to be &lsquo;proud&rsquo; of<br>
To carry forward the tradition of slavery<br>
My own children!<br>
<br>
And then again sometimes he thinks<br>
And looks around to find<br>
The meaning of the saying &ndash; &ldquo;There may be delay but not denial&rdquo;<br>
And starts searching in his hardened hand<br>
The vanishing and dimming lines<br>
<br>
A line drawn on water<br>
Is still taken<br>
To be a line on stone<br>
By my old man.<br>
<br>
HIGHLY SLIGHTED MAN<br>
<br>
Many a time<br>
I get dwarfed<br>
Like a tree cut at the top<br>
Over whom passes the power lines<br>
I get pruned out of season<br>
When in the passing<br>
Someone asks my religion<br>
<br>
Many a time<br>
Gets split water<br>
This statue made of earth<br>
<br>
And words &ndash;<br>
Leave my lips<br>
Like leaves of trees<br>
During the fall<br>
Water starts flowing over my head<br>
The earth does not open to swallow me<br>
When suddenly<br>
Some one asks<br>
My caste.<br>
<br>
Many a time<br>
Tthe skies of my mind<br>
Get dark<br>
With clouds of acute depression<br>
When in the metropolitan air<br>
The free flying bird<br>
Who had come here in surch of food<br>
Sits folding its wings<br>
When all of a sudden<br>
Someone asks its ancestral place.<br>
First village and then the sector.<br>
<br>
Why many a time ?<br>
More than often<br>
The free flying bird<br>
Gets shot<br>
With the arrow of<br>
Religion some time, caste some time<br>
Sector of the village some time<br>
And sub caste some time.<br>
<br>
HE SAID<br>
<br>
He said &ndash;<br>
I have followed you for a long time<br>
Now you follow me<br>
They said &ndash;<br>
We have got the &lsquo;mouth&rsquo;<br>
And you have got the feet<br>
The dharma of the feet is to walk<br>
<br>
He said &ndash;<br>
I have &lsquo;yes-sired&rsquo; you for a long time<br>
Now you show agreement with me.<br>
They said &ndash;<br>
We have got the speech<br>
And you have got the ears<br>
The dharma of the ears is to listen<br>
<br>
He said &ndash;<br>
I am homeless because of you<br>
Please return my dwelling to me<br>
They said &ndash;<br>
Jungle is the home of the tribals<br>
We shall spread the jungle&rsquo;s wind<br>
It is a sin to go against the wind.<br>
<br>
He said &ndash;<br>
I am a &lsquo;bullock with covered eyes<br>
Remove the blinds, let me see<br>
They said &ndash;<br>
Your dharma is not to see<br>
But to ignore what you see<br>
<br>
He said &ndash;<br>
I shall walk against the wind<br>
Your words shall be entrapped like an echo<br>
They said &ndash;<br>
To stop the wind, to entomb the voice<br>
Is now totally impossible, impossible.<br>
<br>
MA TELLS ME<br>
<br>
Ma looks towards me<br>
And also tells me,<br>
Before you were born<br>
He faced the hills beyond<br>
And challenged their might<br>
Straightened the paths<br>
Filled the gaps between valleys<br>
Showed the high mountains their place.<br>
<br>
Ma ---<br>
Brightens up like a sparklet<br>
And tells me<br>
when you were born<br>
He, like Farhad<br>
In the Shivalik hills<br>
Used to dig canals<br>
Night and day<br>
So that there is<br>
Green all around<br>
So that the deserts<br>
Bloom<br>
Prosper the wastelands.<br>
<br>
Ma ---<br>
Tells me -<br>
And also laughs<br>
When you started playing around<br>
Falling and running<br>
Those bridges across the rivers<br>
Were built.<br>
The sunken chest<br>
He became rock-like<br>
Swollen with pride<br>
So that distances get<br>
Narrowed down<br>
So that caravans could pass.<br>
<br>
Ma<br>
Tells me ---<br>
Some thought tortures her<br>
But even so tells me<br>
He called for someone loudly<br>
&quot;I smoothed the fields<br>
Built the palaces<br>
Lifted the sinking motherland&quot;<br>
And they<br>
quietly issued their edict<br>
&quot;You deserve only rebukes<br>
For ages you have<br>
Existed only to<br>
Serve us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ma ---<br>
Tells me<br>
As if saddling the house,<br>
Tells me again and again<br>
There are innumerable<br>
People in the world<br>
But rarely a brave soul<br>
And an image<br>
Comes before my eyes<br>
That of my<br>
old father,<br>
And his lean face<br>
Full of wrinkles<br>
With red eyes<br>
Burning like flames<br>
And now again and again<br>
I think what<br>
Ma told me<br>
Watching the horse<br>
<br>
Ma Looks Towards me<br>
And also tells me,<br>
Before you were born<br>
He faced the hills beyond<br>
And challenged their might<br>
Straightened the paths<br>
Filled the gaps between valleys<br>
Showed the high mountains their place.<br>
<br>
HORSE AND THE OLD MAN<br>
<br>
Riding on his back for age<br>
Are these inhuman<br>
High castes<br>
These religions<br>
There satanic false rites.<br>
<br>
On the naked body<br>
When falls the whip<br>
He doesn't walk<br>
He runs blindly<br>
Forgets the cotton<br>
Choking his ears<br>
The blinds on his eyes<br>
The trap on his mouth<br>
Summer and winter.<br>
<br>
Tied with Smrities<br>
And rules<br>
And those very people<br>
Explain the rules to him<br>
Outside whose doors<br>
He stands<br>
<br>
In a mood for fun<br>
Those very people make<br>
Fun of him.<br>
He sleeps clandestinely<br>
Never saw him sitting<br>
Only saw him made to<br>
Lie by them<br>
When shoes are<br>
Hammered into his hooves<br>
<br>
Eating grass and weeds<br>
Waste from the fields<br>
So active is he<br>
That even time can't<br>
Match his agility<br>
So powerful is he<br>
That even electricity<br>
Faints before him.<br>
<br>
And these days<br>
He has started<br>
Stopping again and again<br>
And resisting<br>
And it seems to me<br>
As if this brave house<br>
As my own old man<br>
As if it is a fresh<br>
Music from the<br>
Tired and bored<br>
Public Mind.<br>
<br>
For centuries<br>
Riding on his back<br>
Are these inhuman<br>
High castes<br>
The religions of this place<br>
And the Satanic<br>
False rites.<br>
<br>
A POET&rsquo;S ASPIRATIOH<br>
<br>
I don&rsquo;t want<br>
My poems<br>
To be like monsoon streams<br>
Ruining and merging with a river<br>
And losing their identity<br>
<br>
I don&rsquo;t want<br>
My poems<br>
To be part of the mainstream<br>
Whose holy books<br>
Divide a vast field into small plots<br>
And segregate into part the velvety greens<br>
To safeguard their caps and hair locks<br>
And forbid the opening of the third eye<br>
For the dark skinned people like me.<br>
<br>
I on the other hand want<br>
My poems<br>
To be like those birds<br>
Who flying across lanes and drains<br>
Of the village descend in any courtyard and<br>
To pick up the grains<br>
Without caring for the high of low dweller<br>
<br>
All I want is that<br>
My poems<br>
Should join that mainstream<br>
Which contains<br>
Eklavya, war songs on Banda Bahadur.<br>
Struggles of Peer Budhu Shah<br>
And the pain of Pablo Neruda<br>
<br>
THE SHRINKING FOCUS<br>
<br>
Much has been left behind<br>
Like childhood<br>
For example ---<br>
My village, my people<br>
Fields, dearer than sons<br>
Trees witness to my love<br>
Like Mirza's acacia.<br>
<br>
This earthen statue<br>
Has passed much<br>
Like water which<br>
Has flowed away<br>
For example ---<br>
Caravan of breaths<br>
Years more than two and a half of<br>
Geeta's chapters<br>
Walls of my love<br>
And hieghts of the hills<br>
Much has been forgotten<br>
Like a dream<br>
For example ---<br>
Birds how to fly<br>
Own heritage<br>
Own language<br>
And the land of Sials' daughters.<br>
Much is still there<br>
Like wife and kids<br>
For example ---<br>
Enmities behind loves<br>
Vanished have relations<br>
Divisions of the waters<br>
And horrible scenes arising<br>
Out of them<br>
And the bird with<br>
Trimmed wings only remembers<br>
Like the blood circulalting<br>
In the body<br>
The thought of picking<br>
Up the scattered feed.<br>
Much has been left behind<br>
Like childhood<br>
For example ---<br>
My village, my people<br>
Fields, dearer than sons<br>
Trees, witness to my love<br>
Like Mirza's acacia.<br>
LIFE<br>
<br>
I want to live with you<br>
As a plant lives with soil<br>
Greenery with leaves<br>
Scenery with eyes.<br>
<br>
Life !<br>
<br>
I want to have such an<br>
Emotional relation with you<br>
As a fish with the sea<br>
Warmth with the Sun<br>
Flower with Scent.<br>
<br>
Life !<br>
I want to pass through<br>
The ups and downs<br>
As a boat passes<br>
Through waves<br>
Some mountain shepherd<br>
Through the lows and highs of the hills.<br>
<br>
Life !<br>
<br>
I wish daily<br>
To became a<br>
Cloud over hot deserts<br>
On spread my wings<br>
Over the little ones<br>
Of the birds<br>
Shivering with cold.<br>
<br>
Life !<br>
<br>
I want to become so vast<br>
As a form of seven seas<br>
A sun of the rainbow<br>
A tree flush will green leaves.<br>
<br>
Life !<br>
<br>
I want to live with you<br>
As a plant lives with soil<br>
Greenry with leaves<br>
Scenery with eyes.<br>
<br>
STREAM<br>
<br>
I think -<br>
What might not have happened<br>
To the standing old trees<br>
When they saw falling<br>
Trees nearby<br>
In a sudden hurricane<br>
And remember<br>
The level of tolerance of those trees<br>
And then automatically<br>
Comes agility in my feet<br>
The bird with the sad end heart<br>
Again gets busy with its flights.<br>

Four poems by Balbir Madhopuri<br>
Translated by T C Ghai<br>
<br>
<br>
MY CASTE<br>
<br>
My caste is always with me<br>
like my complexion<br>
like my shadow.<br>
We are so rolled into one<br>
I&rsquo;m nothing<br>
except my caste,<br>
wherever I am<br>
in the city or in the village<br>
here or across the seas.<br>
<br>
I try very hard to hide,<br>
wear a hundred masks<br>
but it shows itself<br>
again and again<br>
like the white hair<br>
after the dye has worn off<br>
or like the body showing<br>
through tattered clothes<br>
<br>
I wish to be rid of it<br>
like someone wanting a divorce<br>
but they tell me,<br>
this bond stays on<br>
birth after birth...<br>
nothing to think about.<br>
<br>
Finally<br>
the bow is strung<br>
with arrows of contention,<br>
which pierce both past and present.<br>
Blood boils within, like an earthquake<br>
and then<br>
divisions come in the open<br>
up-down, right-left.<br>
<br>
My caste is always with me<br>
like my complexion<br>
like my shadow.<br>
We are so rolled into one<br>
I&rsquo;m nothing<br>
except my caste,<br>
wherever I am<br>
in the city or in the village<br>
here or across the seas.<br>
Tsunami Waves<br>
<br>
The tsunami waves<br>
washed away many things;<br>
rocky shores,<br>
living creatures<br>
fishes and tortoises<br>
trees and humans<br>
beautiful natural landscape<br>
<br>
The waves<br>
wrecked the houses<br>
where God was segregated,<br>
where people<br>
would step in or pass by<br>
shivering, in fear<br>
<br>
And in no time<br>
the land became water<br>
and death ruled all over.<br>
One recalled:<br>
&lsquo;Death is a great leveler.&rsquo;<br>
Yet the survivors sang a different tune.<br>
The living labelled the dead<br>
as high or low<br>
touchable or untouchable .<br>
<br>
In this way<br>
on the sea shore<br>
the &lsquo;not humans&rsquo; were left<br>
hungry, thirsty,<br>
and without hope<br>
by the demonic laughter<br>
of the &lsquo;humans&rsquo;.<br>
<br>
The tsunami waves<br>
that altogether demolished<br>
the rocky shores<br>
could not knock down<br>
the high walls of hatred<br>
that stood in the human hearts.<br>
<br>
In the aftermath<br>
let someone,<br>
on the now calm sea&rsquo;s wide shore,<br>
reflect, and say:<br>
Let us push our boat<br>
into the sea of humaneness<br>
embrace each other like the waves<br>
merge into each other<br>
destroy the poisonous fish.<br>
Come let us play this game.<br>
COME MY FRIEND<br>
<br>
Come, my friend,<br>
let&rsquo;s meet again<br>
just as two pathways meet,<br>
merge into each other<br>
like a river in the sea.<br>
<br>
Come, my friend,<br>
let&rsquo;s sing, in the marketplace,<br>
the death song<br>
for the Sanatani culture<br>
that has divided mankind again and again,<br>
that has no reason to be.<br>
<br>
Come, my friend,<br>
let&rsquo;s bury deep<br>
the &rsquo;living words&rsquo;<br>
that stink,<br>
that don&rsquo;t let you forget<br>
&lsquo;the dead mother&rsquo;<br>
and lacerate so many hearts.<br>
<br>
Come, my friend,<br>
let&rsquo;s give up the kissa tradition<br>
give up the culture of &lsquo;culture&rsquo;<br>
let&rsquo;s load with stones and sink the boat<br>
in which life is a living death<br>
<br>
Come, my friend,<br>
let&rsquo;s fight another Mahabharat<br>
write another sixteenth chapter<br>
dam the river of fire<br>
drive the black spotted pigeon<br>
across the dividing lines<br>
<br>
Come, my friend,<br>
let&rsquo;s bring under the shade<br>
the life that is a desert,<br>
plant flowers in barren lives<br>
and fulfill the duty of words<br>
<br>
Come, my friend,<br>
let&rsquo;s find words<br>
that bring sunshine, air and the sea<br>
that are charged with the energy of a warrior<br>
that make the whole sky fragrant<br>
<br>
Come, my friend,<br>
let&rsquo;s meet again<br>
just as two pathways meet,<br>
merge into each other<br>
like a river in the sea.<br>
My Culture<br>
<br>
Now<br>
even the deserts<br>
have become green.<br>
The barren lands too<br>
are blooming<br>
The natural landscape too<br>
has changed<br>
Yet my culture<br>
drenched in caste<br>
still remains unchanged.<br>
<br>
Now<br>
even the unbounded space<br>
has shrunk<br>
The seven continents too<br>
have become one<br>
like the colors of the rainbow<br>
in the sunlight<br>
The Berlin wall<br>
has come down like a house of glass<br>
and is a heap of sand now<br>
Yet no key can unlock<br>
the stony doors of my culture<br>
that refuses to open up<br>
<br>
Now<br>
even the glaciers<br>
are melting<br>
The waters in the oceans<br>
are warming up<br>
And hot winds too<br>
are blowing at places<br>
Yet my culture<br>
like the consumer culture<br>
still sticks different labels<br>
on human beings<br>
Sunshine and Shade Walk Together<br>
<br>
Water flowed away under the old bridge<br>
The river-swell receded<br>
The duck&rsquo;s body remains dry<br>
even while it moves in water<br>
The frame is old<br>
yet the mirror reflects new light<br>
The wind chases away the cloud<br>
lest it should touch the sky<br>
The wind rubbed past the tree<br>
leaving it stock-still<br>
Why do you blink your eyes:<br>
Sunshine and shade move together<br>
The branch bends low with the weight of the fruit<br>
The tree sways with the wind<br>
When the East wind blows<br>
the tree blooms faster.<br>
Before I Go to Sleep<br>
<br>
My wife lying beside me<br>
never knows<br>
when I,<br>
riding in the lap of the wind,<br>
start chasing a small cloud;<br>
push a boat<br>
into the flooded river<br>
to reach the light shining across;<br>
start ransacking my books<br>
to find the butterfly wings<br>
I had tucked in a book<br>
in my childhood.<br>
<br>
She does not even know<br>
when, trotting on the road,<br>
I break through the red signal<br>
and collide against a dolphin;<br>
when I sweat from every pore,<br>
reminded of travelling in a bus in Punjab<br>
as if Iraq were reminded of America;<br>
and then of the garbled couplets<br>
of a perfect ghazal.<br>
<br>
My wife lying beside me<br>
does not know<br>
when, piercing the darkness<br>
and through closed windows and doors,<br>
I drop down with heavy wings<br>
as if I were drowned in debt<br>
But in truth I wait<br>
in a ramshackle house<br>
for the sun to rise<br>
to see a smile<br>
on my little girl&rsquo;s face.<br>
<br>
When the Hot Wind Blows<br>
<br>
Now when<br>
the hot wind blows<br>
and charan&rsquo;s gardens are devastated,<br>
when many faces disappear<br>
and silence reigns during the day<br>
as if it were night<br>
then I<br>
rush back home reminding myself<br>
of my soft-as-cotton daughter and<br>
my sunshine-like wife &lsquo;s pale faces.<br>
<br>
Now when<br>
someone writes on the wind<br>
draws a line on water<br>
clips the wings of birds in flight<br>
imagines a world in his heart<br>
then<br>
swans drown themselves<br>
in the clear waters of lakes.<br>
And I<br>
like cowards<br>
encircle like a creeper<br>
my soft-as-kitten daughter,<br>
who is just beginning to prattle<br>
and my mulberry-shoot like wife,<br>
and like someone sick<br>
I enclose my small world in my eyes.<br>
<br>
Now when<br>
an earthquake shakes the high mountains<br>
above the piece of earth that&rsquo;s my share,<br>
desire descends like rain,<br>
the sea of sensuality rises unstopably high<br>
then<br>
the toy-like daughter of mine<br>
erects a mud wall<br>
between me and my part of the world<br>
And I<br>
think of raising the height<br>
of walls that enclose my home,<br>
for who knows when the reckless wind<br>
would come crashing through the threshold.<br>
<br>
Consolation<br>
<br>
My dear wife<br>
don&rsquo;t fear the water&rsquo;s rising wave.<br>
It will turn by itself<br>
into an eddy;<br>
waters after all must flow<br>
under the bridges.<br>
<br>
Don&rsquo;t wake my daughter,<br>
lying asleep in her cradle,<br>
who, watching the stars coming out of a sparkler,<br>
turns into a sparkler herself;<br>
and let her dream of filling her lap<br>
by picking the stars swimming in the sky;<br>
and don&rsquo;t ever tell her<br>
that her father&rsquo;s dreams<br>
of swinging on the rainbow,<br>
of bringing down the moon<br>
and placing it on his wife&rsquo;s forehead<br>
have come to nought.<br>
<br>
Don&rsquo;t tell<br>
my butterfly-like<br>
butterfly-catching<br>
lighter-than-flowers daughter<br>
that the procession of sins is endless;<br>
otherwise her dolls would drop down her hands;<br>
rather you should tell her<br>
that her father holds<br>
pigeons in his left hand<br>
and eagles in his right one.<br>
<br>
You should let my fragrance-like daughter<br>
draw pigeons and doves<br>
in her notebook as before,<br>
and set them to fly.<br>
My good wife<br>
don&rsquo;t be afraid of the whirlwinds<br>
for they are godless.<br>
Don&rsquo;t fear the tidal waves,<br>
my dear wife,<br>
waters after all<br>
must flow under the bridges<br>
Waiting for a Cool Breeze<br>
<br>
The sunshine dies at high noon<br>
and there is no shade<br>
The trees are bereft of their branches<br>
Only a few remain<br>
Anthills have risen under every tree<br>
There is no shade to sit under<br>
The five rivers<br>
shed tears, where they are<br>
<br>
Pistols and guns grow<br>
where flowers and ears of corn grew<br>
One is at a loss<br>
for these demand blood for watering<br>
Why no one stops the destructive hailstorms<br>
is a deep mystery<br>
The masters reap what they sow<br>
and yet they complain.<br>
<br>
The skies swing in hopelessness<br>
The stars fall<br>
Courtyards are drowned in mourning<br>
The walls shiver<br>
How can one stop this wind<br>
that is spreading all around<br>
Bodies hard as stone are worn down<br>
in the stream of bitterness.<br>
<br>
Bodies like cypress should not fall<br>
A crane should not stray from the flock<br>
Doves should coo in courtyards<br>
A cool breeze should blow from somewhere<br>
People should not come to mourn in droves<br>
Nor a mare be without its rider<br>
Winds should become fragrant<br>
Minds glow with good sense<br>
The Sunshine&rsquo;s Journey<br>
<br>
The break of day<br>
is like a siren for her<br>
As soon as she wakes<br>
she begins to water the plants<br>
and the flowers big and small<br>
bloom and spread their fragrance<br>
<br>
And I<br>
while slurping my tea<br>
turn over the pages of the newspaper<br>
in search of state-of-the-nation news &#9148;<br>
how one faction<br>
has battered the other<br>
and I am reminded<br>
of some slokas of Tulsi and Manu<br>
<br>
That&rsquo;s how<br>
her morning turns into noon<br>
and she spreads the shade of her being<br>
on the blooming flowers<br>
and the difference<br>
between the tall mulberry tree<br>
and her<br>
seems to disappear<br>
<br>
That&rsquo;s how her noon<br>
mellows<br>
That&rsquo;s how her noon<br>
has mellowed<br>
<br>
Whenever I return home<br>
riding my mare<br>
through dark and narrow lanes<br>
she standing at the door<br>
catches the mare&rsquo;s rein<br>
and the tidal wave<br>
surging through her heart<br>
recedes<br>
A light shines in her eyes<br>
and the earth<br>
seems peaceful to her<br>
<br>
That&rsquo;s how<br>
her morning begins<br>
That&rsquo;s how<br>
her noon descends<br>
That&rsquo;s how<br>
her noon mellows<br>
That&rsquo;s how<br>
her high noon has mellowed<br>
My Life (to My Wife)<br>
<br>
Ever since she has stood beside me<br>
we are not two but eleven<br>
My feet sail above the ground<br>
I have left far behind<br>
the jungle of deep sorrows<br>
I have surrendered before her love<br>
weapons shaped by resentments and anger,<br>
plans of animosities and revenge<br>
<br>
She has sowed<br>
in my heart<br>
the seeds of a new revolt<br>
just as she is nurturing<br>
in her body<br>
our heir to come.<br>
<br>
She has covered<br>
the net of my vices and imperfections<br>
just as the skin hides<br>
the network of blood vessels and entrails<br>
But she lays bare<br>
the journey of my feet<br>
that have negotiated many ditches and bumps<br>
left and right, back and front;<br>
how I swam across wide rivers;<br>
my forthright utterances<br>
in public places.<br>
<br>
She is very secretive<br>
like thoughts dissolved in blood<br>
Sometimes<br>
in fact many times<br>
she calls<br>
me Krishna<br>
and herself Radha<br>
me Shiva<br>
and herself Parvati<br>
She builds a bridge<br>
between the Aryan and the non-Aryan<br>
and for my sake<br>
she has absorbed much<br>
just as the earth has absorbed<br>
poisonous chemicals<br>
When we go out<br>
to rent a house<br>
or face insults<br>
while visiting a religious place<br>
she questions the conscience of humans.<br>
Then she shines all the more<br>
like the sun<br>
and filled with joy she says,<br>
our heir, born of our union,<br>
will bring heaven on earth<br>
and spread his eyelids<br>
for people to walk on.<br>
<br>
I stare at her<br>
goggle-eyed and<br>
see the present and future<br>
through the past.<br>
Waves in the Mind<br>
<br>
Walking through the crisscross of roads<br>
passing through life&rsquo;s blind alleys<br>
I see in front of me<br>
milky corncobs as if spinning cotton<br>
blooming wheat and paddy<br>
stalks more fragile than glass;<br>
and beside them some crops already withering.<br>
I am witness to this silent lamentation.<br>
<br>
One remembers<br>
fissures in the drought-stricken fields,<br>
like the cracks in the elders&rsquo; heels;<br>
oxen biting into withered stubble<br>
like sisters, born one after the other,<br>
chewing at their mother&rsquo;s dry teats;<br>
and father&rsquo;s quiet prayers,<br>
both said and unsaid,<br>
for flowers to bloom for everyone<br>
for the drying crops to green again,<br>
I quietly translate to myself.<br>
<br>
The water channel dug on the southern side<br>
seems becoming unbridgeable day by day,<br>
which neither I nor my upper caste friend<br>
could ever swim and go across<br>
rebelling against the banks we stood on.<br>
The river of friendship wants to flow<br>
riding over the furrows like old men&rsquo;s wrinkles,<br>
in spite of the silt or marble<br>
because water seeks its own level.<br>
An Oasis (to my friend Purshotam Sharma)<br>
<br>
At times<br>
he is distant like the sun<br>
and close like the sunshine<br>
At times<br>
reminded of my adolescence days<br>
I am filled with warmth<br>
At others<br>
his speech scorches<br>
Whenever I unroll<br>
the folds of the past<br>
I see him<br>
sometimes as my crutches<br>
sometimes as my wings<br>
<br>
Whenever I descend<br>
into dark endless caves<br>
or a boggy hell<br>
he is like the steadfast polestar<br>
<br>
Sometimes he is the sunshine<br>
Sometimes an umbrella<br>
Sometimes a protective sword<br>
Sometimes the LakshmanRekha<br>
<br>
During a drought<br>
he is a dew drop<br>
In the desert<br>
he is an oasis<br>
The Contracting Circle<br>
<br>
Many things have been left behind<br>
like my childhood:<br>
My village, my people<br>
Fields dearer than sons<br>
Trees like Mirza&rsquo;aJand<br>
witness to a love tale<br>
<br>
This clayey figure<br>
has crossed many landmarks<br>
like waters that have flowed past:<br>
Lived through years<br>
breath after breath<br>
two and a half times<br>
the number of chapters in the Gita;<br>
Scaled the walls of love and infatuation<br>
and many mountains<br>
<br>
I have forgotten many things<br>
like dreams:<br>
The flight of birds<br>
My ancestry<br>
My language<br>
The land of Siyals&rsquo; daughters.<br>
<br>
There&rsquo;s much I remember<br>
like my wife and children:<br>
A few names and places<br>
Fights over love<br>
Relationships that are dead<br>
Horrifying scenes of slaughter<br>
over water sharing<br>
And the wingless bird thinks only,<br>
like blood coursing through the body,<br>
of picking the feed that lies scattered.<br>
<br>
The Sky is Witness<br>
<br>
Many eyes<br>
were riveted on deserted pathways<br>
to lovingly welcome someone;<br>
but the pathways had devoured<br>
the footprints of the home-comers.<br>
<br>
Many fields<br>
waited for the soft touch of the feet<br>
that never weighed heavy on them<br>
like those of strangers.<br>
<br>
Many oxen<br>
bellowed for the hands<br>
whose one pat would relieve<br>
their daylong fatigue.<br>
<br>
Dogs like Moti&#9148;<br>
members of family &#9148;<br>
sat disheartened<br>
wondering for whom<br>
should they wag their tails.<br>
<br>
A heart would suddenly<br>
start beating fast<br>
on seeing a clayey figure<br>
become a tiger, with a weapon in hand.<br>
<br>
The sky has absorbed<br>
the tragedy of the five rivers<br>
the winds of conspiracy<br>
the tearfulness of the exploding clouds<br>
the memory of falling stars<br>
the sound of tender shoots cracking.</p>

The poet desires that his poetry should have a direction and provide meaningful guidance to the people and hopes to inspire others despite being ‘dark-skinned’ that has an explicit message for the society. And the English version by T.C. Ghai recreates the same intense emotions and delivers humanitarian message to awaken society towards stimulating Dalit consciousness.</p>
